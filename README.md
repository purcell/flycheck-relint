flycheck-relint
===============

This library provides a Flycheck checker for `rx` and string regular
expressions in Emacs Lisp files, using
[relint](https://elpa.gnu.org/packages/relint.html).

Use relint 1.15 - 1.24, this is not yet compatible with 2.0

Installation
------------

The recommended way to get `flycheck-relint` is as a package from the
[MELPA](https://melpa.org) repository. The version of `flycheck-relint` there will
always be up-to-date. There may also be packages in [MELPA
Stable](https://stable.melpa.org), which track the latest numbered tag.

To register the checker, use something like this in your emacs startup file:

```el
(with-eval-after-load 'flycheck
  (flycheck-relint-setup))
```

For use-package:

```el
(use-package flycheck-relint
  :after (flycheck relint)
  :config (flycheck-relint-setup))
```
